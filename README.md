This is Mike Zhang from Imperial College London.
The FYP topic is Smart tape measures for health observations of neonates, mainly discussing tape inductance measurement

This includes the code, proteus simulation file, PCB design and testing data.

The Arduino code file includes the code for the 4 Ways version and 30 Ways version design and a version for the uno proteus test.

The data collection.xlsx file includes the test results. the first sheet is known inductance testing, the second is 30 ways version testing and the third is 4 ways version testing.

The proteus file includes the proteus simulation model of the inductance measurement circuit.
